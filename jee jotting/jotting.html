">Admission to numerous undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional degree programmes is done through the JEE entrance test. After the 12th grade, students have little knowledge about their future employment. Different entrance tests come in different forms. Despite the fact that there are numerous state-level exams for engineering admission. One of the national level tests is the JEE (joint admission exam). Here are some crucial inquiries that JEE Mains must have answers to.</h2>
<h2 style="
    margin-left: 10px;
">The JEE is divided into two sections: JEE Main and JEE Advanced. All candidates may take the first level of the exam, known as JEE Main. The top 2,50,000 JEE Main candidates go to the second and final level of the test, JEE Advanced.

Physics, chemistry, and maths multiple-choice questions (MCQs) make up the computer-based test (CBT) known as JEE Main. JEE Advanced is a CBT exam with two exams that each include MCQs from the subjects of physics, chemistry, and mathematics.

Everything you need to know about JEE Mains is because it's one of the toughest and most competitive exams in India, and because JEE scores serve as the foundation for many other exams.</h2>
